# Q-Q Plots and Data Fitting

## Overview

This project involves generating **Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots** and performing **data fitting** techniques to analyze the distribution of datasets. The Q-Q plots are used to assess whether a given data sample comes from a certain distribution, while data fitting methods help in modeling and understanding the relationships within the data.

## Contents

- **Q-Q Plots**: Visualizing the quantiles of the sample data compared to the theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution.
- **Data Fitting**: Applying various data fitting techniques to model the dataset and evaluate the goodness of fit.

The notebook contains the following:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Q-Q Plot generation using `matplotlib` or similar libraries
- Fitting data using different models (linear, polynomial, etc.)
- Goodness-of-fit tests

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `pandas`

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pandas
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Class 1 and 2 Phy Lab.ipynb"
   ```

3. Run the cells in sequence to generate Q-Q plots and fit the data.
